usage: %s {option} [command]
   /#: view the statistic of JOIN'ed drives in the CDS table
   /!: like /#; initialize the JOIN-flag, if it differs
   /f: view non-printable characters hexadecimal
   /a: view the CDS table after the command
   /k: create the pathes mentioned within the command
   /t: like /k, in SUBST check only, if path exist
   /_: dump all attributes within the CDS table
   /o=#: use this backslash offset, do not calculate itself
   /x=??: List of drive letters to be ignored while a ::label: search

   without command: displays the CDS table
   command:
     -: initialize all SUBST'ed and JOIND'ed drives
     --: initialize all non-networked drives
     dr [-]path: like %s dr [-]path
     /u dr [-]path: substitute dr to point to path
     /j dr [-]path: join dr into path
     /d dr | dr /d | dr - : initialize drive dr (& break SUBST/JOIN)
     /s dr1 dr2: swap dr1 and dr2
     /n [dr1 dr2]: swap unit numbers of the same device driver (Std.: floppies)
     /w dr: set ERRORLEVEL to the drive letter of dr
     /m [-]path: create path including all leading up-directories
     /c [-]path: like /m, then chdir into it
     dr:[+-=]{off,on,phys,net,join,subst,hidden}: set drive flags directly
     /q dr:[+-]{phys,net,join,subst,hidden}: query the drive flags

>>>>>>E_SUBST_E 127
Substitutes a path by a drive letter.

SUBST [drive1: [drive2:]path]
SUBST drive1: /D

 drive1:        drive letter to substitute
 [drive2:]path  drive and path to be accessed via drive1:
 /D             breaks off the relation between drive1 and drive2:path

SUBST without any parameters views all virtual drives created by SUBST.

>>>>>>E_JOIN_E 127
Joins a drive into a directory of another drive.

JOIN [drive1: [drive2:]path]
JOIN drive1: /D

 drive1:        drive to be accessed via path drive2:path
 [drive2:]path  drive and path, in which drive1 is to be joined.
 /D             breaks off the relation between drive1 and drive2:path

JOIN without any parameters views all virtual drives created by JOIN.
