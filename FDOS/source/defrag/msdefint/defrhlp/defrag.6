$[CENTER](Defragmenting the drive)
$(-)

Optimizing the drive is done by putting file fragments 
together.

There are a number of methods to optimize the drive:

* unfragment files only
    
    Defragments all files on the drive, but may leave some wholes 
    between files.
    
    This is the fastest way to defragment.

* full defragmentation

    Defragments all files and moves all data to the start of the disk.
    
* files first
  
    Defragments all files on the disk. Moving all files first on the 
    disk, before the directories.
    
* directories first

    Defragments all files on the disk. Moving all directories first on 
    the disk, before the files.
    
* crunch only

    Move all files to the start of the disk, without defragmenting it. 
    
    This should be used to move all data to the front of the disk only.
