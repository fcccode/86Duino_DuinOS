$[CENTER](Improving defragmentation speed)
$(-)

In order to run defrag as fast as possible, you have to have as much 
free memory as possible. 

This means:
- You have to unload all unneeded drivers and TSRs from memory
- You have to configure all extended memory as XMS

To do this, you can make a boot floppy with the command
    
c:\>sys a:

And add a config.sys file with the following content:

device=c:\freedos\bin\himem.sys

For convenience you could add an autoexec.bat with the content:

c:\freedos\bin\defrag

This should ensure that you have as much free memory as possible.
