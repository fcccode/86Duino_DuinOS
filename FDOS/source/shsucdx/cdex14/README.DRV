     SHSUDRVX is a CD driver/controller emulator I have found useful for
     test purposes.  It emulates two 2 CD drives loaded with ISO ROMS.

     Drive 0 has a single text file in the root directory.  This file is
     also listed in the Abstract field of the primary volume descriptor(PVD).
     The file name in the directory entry contains lower case charaters for
     test purpose.  There is also a text string in the BiblioID field for
     test purposes.

     In the root directory of Drive 1 there is a copyright file and a sub-
     directory.  The copyright file is a text file and is listed in the PVD
     copyright ID field.  The HELLO.EXE in the HELLO sub-directory is
     executable.

     SHSUDRVX is loaded from the command line before loading a re-director
     such as SHSUCDX.
