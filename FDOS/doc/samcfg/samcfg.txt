SAMCFG

SAMCFG is a set of files for creating the config.sys configuration script 
and the autoexec.bat startup script.

Entries are processor-dependant:
* 8086: no memory manager installed as no XMS, nor EMS (provide own driver if EMS expansion card)
* 80186: same
* 80286: XMS is available through the FDXMS286 driver, EMS requires your own hardware + driver
* 80386: XMS is available through the HIMEM driver, UMBs and EMS through JEMM386/JEMMEX
