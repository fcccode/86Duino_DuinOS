XMGR

XMGR is an extended memory driver for DOS. It requires a 386 or better processor
and can provide access to up to 4GB of system memory.
You're encouraged to actually use the XMS through either:
* a ramdisk driver (RDISK or others)
* a filecache driver (UIDE, LBAcache, CDRcache or others)
* protected mode programs
