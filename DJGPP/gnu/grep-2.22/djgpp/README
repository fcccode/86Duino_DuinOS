This is a port of GNU grep 2.22  to MSDOS/DJGPP.

  This is GNU grep, the "fastest grep in the west" (we hope).  GNU grep is
  based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about twice as fast as
  stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper search for a fixed
  string that eliminates impossible text from being considered by the full
  regexp matcher without necessarily having to look at every character.  The
  result is typically many times faster than Unix grep or egrep.  (Regular
  expressions containing backreferencing will run more slowly, however.)



1.:     DJGPP specific changes.
        =======================

        This port has been configured using DJGPP 2.05.  It has been configured
        to be build in the /_build directory under the top srcdir.

        The port has been configured and compiled on WinXP SP3.  There is no
        guarantee that this may be possible with any other DOS-like OS.  Due
        to the use of long file names it will not be possible to configure and
        compile without LFN support.

        The port has been compiled using gcc520 and bnu225br2.

        This port provides no NLS support for the version compiled with djdev205.
        It has been configured with NLS support disabled by passing the no-nls
        flag as argument to config.bat.  If you prefer NLS support you will have
        to reconfigure the sources omitting the no-nls flag when calling config.bat.

        When paths are checked to be directories, the code has been changed to
        use access() instead of stat().  Due to amount of work that it is to
        compute the stat of the file, using access() should give certain speed
        improvement.

        This port offers colorization support.  Please read the documentation
        to learn how the default colors used can be changed.

        This port has been configured with perl-regexp (pcre) support enabled.
        This means that you will have to install pcre libray available as:
          ftp://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2tk/pcre837b.zip
        if you decide to compile the the preconfigured sources.  If you prefer
        to disable the pcre support you will have to reconfigure and recompile
        the sources again, but this time passing the "no-pcre" command line
        option to config.bat.  The zip file contains only the one build with
        perl-regexp support enabled.

        The port has no wide character/multi byte support at all.

        To build this port and run the testsuite you will need LFN support.

        Starting with grep-2.21 the GREP_OPTIONS environment variable is no
        longer supported.  But this environment variable is set in djgpp.env
        and thus everytime grep is started it issues a warning message either
        to STDOUT or to STDERR.  This may make scripts fail that analyse the
        grep output.  If you use grep 2.21 you should remove the GREP_OPTIONS
        entry from your djgpp.env.

        As usual, all djgpp specific files (config.bat, diffs, README files,
        etc.) are stored in the /djgpp directory.

        For further information about GNU grep please read the info docs and NEWS file.


2.:     Installing the binary package.
        ==============================

2.1.:   Copy the binary distribution into the top DJGPP installation directory,
        just unzip it preserving the directory structure running *ONE* of the
        following commands:
          unzip32 grep222b.zip      or
          djtarx grep222b.zip       or
          pkunzip -d grep222b.zip


3.:     Building the binaries from sources.
        ===================================

3.1.:   Create a temporary directory and copy the source package into the
        directory.  If you download the source distribution from one of the
        DJGPP sites, just unzip it preserving the directory structure
        running *ONE* of the following commands:
          unzip32 grep222s.zip      or
          djtarx grep222s.zip       or
          pkunzip -d grep222s.zip

3.2.:   To build the binaries you will need the following binary packages:
          djdev205.zip (or a later but NOT a prior version)
          bsh205bbr3.zip (or a later but NOT a prior version)
          gccNNNb.zip, gppNNN.zip, bnuNNNb.zip, makNNNb.zip, filNNNb.zip,
          shlNNNb.zip, txtNNNb.zip, txiNNNb.zip, grepNNNb.zip, sedNNNb.zip,
          pcreNNNb.zip, mktmpNNb.zip and gwkNNNb.zip.

        If you want to configure and compile this packages with NLS support
        enabled you must install licvNNNb.zip, lunsNNNb.zip and gtxNNNNb.zip.

        If you want to run the check you will need also:
          difNNNb.zip and mktmpNNNb.zip

        NNN represents the latest version number of the binary packages.  All
        this packages can be found in the /v2gnu directory of any
        ftp.delorie.com mirror.
        You will need bsh205bbr3.zip or later and *NOT* a prior version or
        the build will fail.  The same applies to djdev205.zip.

3.3.:   The package has been configured for DJGPP 2.05.  There is a separate
        build directory under the top srcdir (aka grep-2.21).  To build
        the binaries cd into _build.205 directory.  If for some reason you want
        to reconfigure the package cd into the build directory and run the
        following commands:
          del config.cache
          make clean
          ..\djgpp\config ./..

        Please note that you *MUST* delete the config.cache file in the /djgpp
        directory or you will not really reconfigure the sources because the
        configuration informations will be read from the cache file instead
        of being newly computed.

        config.bat, among other things, will start the configure script passing
        to it a couple of arguments.  You can control these argument passing the
        following command line arguments to config.bat:
          nls or no-nls, default nls.  NLS support enabled.
          cache or no-cache, default cache.  Cache in build directory.
          dep or no-dep, default no-dep.  No dependency tracking.
          pcre or no-pcre, default pcre.  Link grep with libpcre to enable
                                          perl-regexp support.
        All other configure specific options are not set by config.bat so their
        values are left as they are.  If no arguments are passed to config.bat
        then the default values are used.


        To build the programs in a directory other than where the sources are,
        you must add the parameter that specifies the source directory,
        e.g:
          x:\src\gnu\grep-2.22\djgpp\config x:/src/gnu/grep-2.22

        Lets assume you want to build the binaries in a directory placed on a
        different drive (z:\build in this case) from where the sources are,
        then you will run the following commands:
          z:
          md \build
          cd \build
          x:\src\gnu\grep-2.22\djgpp\config x:/src/gnu/grep-2.22

        The order of the options and the srcdir option does not matter.  You
        *MUST* use forward slashes to specify the source directory.

        The batch file will set same environment variables, make MSDOS specific
        modifications to the Makefile.in's and supply all other needed options
        to the configure script.

3.4.:   To compile the package run from the directory where you have configured
        the sources the command:
          make

3.5.:   Now you can run the tests if you like.  Start the command:
          make check

        The yesno test will fail.  This is not a port issue.
        All tests that involve multi-byte character sets will be skipped.

3.6.:   To install the binaries and info docs run the following command from
        the directory where you have configured the sources:
          make install

        This will install the products into your DJGPP installation tree given
        by the default prefix "/dev/env/DJDIR".  If you prefer to install them
        into some other directory you will have to set prefix to the appropriate
        value:
          make install prefix=z:/some/other/place
