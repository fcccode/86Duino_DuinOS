This is a port of GNU Sed 4.2.2 to MSDOS/DJGPP.

1.:     DJGPP specific changes.
        =======================

      - This version of the port will support the generation of 8+3 valid
        backup names for input file names if only SFN support is available.
        This concerns the '-i' option (in-place editing).
      - The port will open the input stream in binary mode.  This will allow to
        process files that contain embedded ^Z and lone ^M characters.
      - This version of the port no longer support the bootstrapping of sed.
      - You will need LFN support to configure and compile the source package.
        I have no plans to support SFN systems to build the sed binaries.
      - No support for DJGPP's own regex function.  They no longer do match the
        GNU regex ones.  Here some work needs to be done before DJGPP's
        functions will again be a one-to-one substitute of GNU regex.
      - To build the binary the CVS repository version of popen/pclose and
        unistd.h are used.

        As usual, all djgpp specific files (config.bat, diffs, readme files,
        etc.) are located in the djgpp subdir.


2.:     Installing the binary package.
        ==============================

2.1.:   Copy the binary distribution into the top DJGPP installation directory
        and unzip it running *ONE* of the following commands:
          unzip32 sed422b.zip      or
          djtarx sed422b.zip       or
          pkunzip -d sed422b.zip

2.2.:   If there is no entry for the sed info docs in your dir file, located
        info directory, create one running the command:
          install-info --info-dir=/dev/env/DJDIR/info /dev/env/DJDIR/info/sed.info

        For further information about GNU Sed please read the info docs and the NEWS file.


3.:     Building the binaries from sources.
        ===================================

3.1.:   To build the binaries you will need the following binary packages:
          djdev203.zip (patch level 2, see the djdev203.dsm)
          bsh204br2.zip, gccNNNb.zip, bnuNNNb.zip, makNNNb.zip,
          filNNNb.zip, shlNNNb.zip, txtNNNb.zip, txiNNNb.zip,
          grepNNNb.zip, sedNNNb.zip and difNNNb.zip.
        NNN stands for the current version of that port.  All these packages can
        be found in the /v2gnu directory of ftp.delorie.com and any mirror.
        Previous versions of those packages may do the job as well but I have
        not tested this.

3.2.:   Create a temporary directory. Copy the source package: sed422s.zip
        into the directory and unzip it running ONE of the following commands:
          unzip32 sed422s.zip      or
          djtarx sed422s.zip       or
          pkunzip -d sed422s.zip

3.3.:   If for some reason you want to reconfigure the package cd into the top
        srcdir (sed-4.2-2) and run the following commands:
          del djgpp\config.cache
          make distclean
          djgpp\config

        Please note that you *MUST* delete the config.cache file in the /djgpp
        subdir or you will not really reconfigure the sources because the
        configuration informations will be read from the cache file instead
        of being newly computed.
        To build the programs in a directory other than where the sources are,
        you must add the parameter that specifies the source directory,
        e.g:
          x:\src\gnu\sed-4.2-2\djgpp\config x:/src/gnu/sed-4.2-2
        or:
          x:\src\gnu\sed-4.2-2\djgpp\xp-config x:/src/gnu/sed-4.2-2

        Lets assume you want to build the binaries in a directory placed on a
        different drive (z:\build in this case) from where the sources are,
        then you will run the following commands:
          z:
          md \build
          cd \build
          x:\src\gnu\sed-4.2-2\djgpp\config x:/src/gnu/sed-4.2-2
        or:
          x:\src\gnu\sed-4.2-2\djgpp\xp-config x:/src/gnu/sed-4.2-2

        The order of the options and the srcdir option does not matter. You
        *MUST* use forward slashes to specify the source directory.

        The batch file will set same environment variables, make MSDOS specific
        modifications to the Makefile.ins and supply all other needed options
        to the configure script.


3.4.:   To compile the package run from the directory where you have configured
        the sources the command:
          make

3.5.:   Now you can run the tests if you like. From the directory where you have
        configured the sources run the command:
          make check

        No one of the tests should fail no matter if you have used stock djdev203
        or beta djdev204.

3.6.:   To install the binary, info docs and man pages run the following command
        from the top srcdir:
          make install

        This will install the products into your DJGPP installation tree given
        by the default prefix "/dev/env/DJDIR". If you prefer to install them
        into some other directory you will have to set prefix to the appropriate
        value.
        Example:
          make install prefix=z:/some/other/dir
