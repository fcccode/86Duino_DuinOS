DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       GGttaaggss  recursively collect the source files under the cur-
       rent directory, pickup symbols and write the  cross-refer-
       ence  data  into tag files ('GTAGS', 'GRTAGS', 'GSYMS' and
       'GPATH').  You should execute this command at the root  of
       the source tree.

       C, C++, yacc, java, PHP and Assembly source files are sup-
       ported.  Files whose names end in '.c' or '.h' are assumed
       to  be C source files and are searched for C style routine
       and macro definitions.  Files whose names  end  in  '.c++'
       '.cc' '.cpp' '.cxx' '.hxx' '.hpp' '.C' '.H' are assumed to
       be C++ source files.  Files whose names end  in  '.y'  are
       assumed to be YACC source files.  Files whose names end in
       '.java' are assumed to be Java source files.  Files  whose
       names end in '.php' '.php3' '.phtml' are assumed to be PHP
       source files.  Files whose names end in '.s' or  '.S'  are
       assumed  to  be  Assembler  source files.  Other files are
       searched for C style definitions.

       The following options are available:

       ----ccoonnffiigg[=_n_a_m_e]
              Show the value of config variable _n_a_m_e.  If _n_a_m_e is
              not specified then show whole of config entry.

       --ff, ----ffiillee _f_i_l_e
              Read from _f_i_l_e a list of file names which should be
              considered as the candidate of  source  files.   By
              default,  all files under the current directory are
              considered as the candidate.  If _f_i_l_e is '-',  read
              from  standard input.  File names must be separated
              by newline.

       ----ggttaaggssccoonnff _f_i_l_e
              Load user's configuration from _f_i_l_e.

       ----ggttaaggssllaabbeell _l_a_b_e_l
              _l_a_b_e_l is used as the label of  configuration  file.
              The default is default.

       --ii, ----iinnccrreemmeennttaall
              Update  tag files incrementally. You had better use
              gglloobbaall(1) with the -u option.

       --II, ----iidduuttiillss
              Make index files for iidduuttiillss(1).

       --nn, ----mmaaxx--aarrggss _n_u_m_b_e_r
              Maximum number of  arguments  for  ggttaaggss--ppaarrsseerr(1).
              By default, gtags invokes the parser with arguments
              as a lot as possible to decrease the  frequency  of
              invoking.

       --qq, ----qquuiieett
              Quiet mode.

       --vv, ----vveerrbboossee
              Verbose mode.

       --ww, ----wwaarrnniinngg
              Print warning messages.

       _d_b_p_a_t_h The  directory  in  which  tag files are generated.
              The default is the current directory.  It is useful
              when your source directory is on a read only device
              like CDROM.

       GGTTAAGGSSCCAACCHHEE
              If  this  variable is set, its value is used as the
              size of btree cache. The default is 500000 (bytes).

       The following configuration variables affect the execution
       of ggttaaggss.  You can see the default value for each variable
       with the ----ccoonnffiigg option.

       GTAGS(string)
              If  this  variable is set, its value is used as the
              command line of parser for GTAGS.  The  default  is
              'gtags-parser -dt %s'.

       GRTAGS(string)
              If  this  variable is set, its value is used as the
              command line of parser for GRTAGS. The  default  is
              'gtags-parser -dtr %s'.

       GSYMS(string)
              If  this  variable is set, its value is used as the
              command line of parser for GSYMS.  The  default  is
              'gtags-parser -dts %s'.

       skip(comma separated list)
              GGttaaggss  skips files which listed in this list.  As a
              special exception, ggttaaggss collect values from multi-
              ple skip variables.  If the value ends with '/', it
              assumed as a directory and ggttaaggss  skips  all  files
              under  it.  If the value start with '/', it assumed
              relative path from the root of source directory.

       suffixes(comma separated list)
              Suffixes of  target  source  file.   As  a  special
              exception,  ggttaaggss collect values from multiple suf-
              fixes variables.  This variable  is  obsoleted.  If
              the  langmap  variable  is  defined ggttaaggss no longer
              refers this.

       icase_path(boolean)
              Ignore case distinctions  in  the  path.   Suffixes
              check are affected by this capability.

       langmap(comma separated list)
              Language mapping. Each comma-separated map consists
              of the language name, a colon, and a list  of  file
              extensions.         Default        mapping       is
              'c:.c.h,yacc:.y,asm:.s.S,java:.java,cpp:.c++.cc.cpp.cxx.hxx.hpp.C.H,php:.php.php3.phtml'.

       'GTAGS', 'GRTAGS' and 'GSYMS' are very large.  In  advance
       of using this command, check the space of your disk.

       Assembler  support is far from complete.  It extracts only
       ENTRY() and ALTENTRY() from source file.   Probably  valid
       only for FreeBSD and Linux kernel source.

       There is no concurrency control about tag files.

       Symbols  in  Assembly  source  files are not extracted for
       'GSYMS'.
