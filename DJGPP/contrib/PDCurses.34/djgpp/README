This is a port of PDCurses 3.4 to MSDOS/DJGPP.


1.:     DJGPP specific changes.
        =======================

        There are no DJGPP specific changes to sources.  Only the Makefile for
        DJGPP has been modified to produce a library zip archive that reflects
        the stock DJGPP installation tree.  The diffs file shows the changes.
        The library documentation is located in /contrib/PDCurses.NNN and
        /gnudocs/PDCurses.NNN, where NNN stands for the version number.



2.:     Installing the library package.
        ===============================

2.1.:   Copy the binary distribution into the top DJGPP installation directory,
        just unzip it preserving the directory structure running *ONE* of the
        following commands:
          unzip32 pdcurNNNa.zip      or
          djtarx pdcurNNNa.zip       or
          pkunzip -d pdcurNNNa.zip
        where NNN stands for the version number.



3.:     Building the binaries from sources.
        ===================================

3.1.:   Create a temporary directory, copy the source package into that
        directory and just unzip it preserving the directory structure
        running *ONE* of the following commands:
          unzip32 pdcurNNNs.zip      or
          djtarx pdcurNNNs.zip       or
          pkunzip -d pdcurNNNs.zip
        where NNN stands for the version number.

3.2.:   To build the binaries you will need the following binary packages:
          djdev203.zip (or a later but NOT a prior version)
          bsh204b.zip  (or a later but NOT a prior version)
          gccNNNb.zip, bnuNNNb.zip, makNNNb.zip, filNNNb.zip, shlNNNb.zip
          and txtNNNb.zip

        NNN represents the latest version number of the binary packages. All
        this packages can be found in the /v2gnu directory of any
        ftp.delorie.com mirror.
        You will need bsh204b.zip or later and *NOT* a prior version or
        the build will fail.  The same applies to djdev203.zip.

3.3.:   The sources are compiled using the DJGPP specific Makefile stored in the
        /dos directory.  This is gccdos.mak.  To compile the package run from
        the /dos directory the command:
          make -f gccdos.mak all
        This will produce the libraries, some test programs, and a manual.

3.4.:   Now you can run the tests if you like.  From the /dos directory run the
        command:
          testcurs

        There are some other example and/or test binaries.  You can run and
        inspect their code if you like.

3.5.:   To install the headers, libraries and docs run the following command
        from the /dos directory:
          make -f gccdos.mak install

        This will install the products into your DJGPP installation tree given
        by the default prefix "/dev/env/DJDIR".  If you prefer to install them
        into some other directory you will have to set prefix to the appropiate
        value:
          make -f gccdos.mak install prefix=z:/some/other/place

        mailing list.
        Send suggestions and bug reports concerning the DJGPP port to

Enjoy.
